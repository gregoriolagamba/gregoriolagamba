## Hello 👋

My name is **Gregorio La Gamba** and I currently work at **Eni Plenitude** as an **IT Solution Architect**.

I use this GitHub account to explore ideas, experiment with technologies, and carry out small projects, with a strong focus on real-world applicability and the **practical adoption of AI in corporate environments**.

🌱 I am currently deepening my knowledge of **artificial intelligence** and **code development using AI tools**.

📫 How to contact me: via [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoriolagamba/) (or GitHub issues/discussions, for project-related topics)

⚡ Fun facts:
- I am deeply interested in the **ethical implications of technology** and how innovation can help us regain time, focus, and creativity instead of consuming them.
- I periodically publish articles on personal growth in my newsletter [**“Fermate Brevi”**](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7327759417959964672/) on LinkedIn.
